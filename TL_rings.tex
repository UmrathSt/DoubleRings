\section{Transmission Line Theory for a single ring}
Consider a square unit-cell of edge length $L$ and a copper ring of outer Radius $R$ and width $w$ in it.
The ring can be modelled by transmission line theory to behave as a series RLC-circuit. 
The single ring has an inductance of:
\begin{equation}
L = \mu_0 (R-w) \ln\left(
\frac{16(R-w)}{w}-2
\right)
\end{equation}
