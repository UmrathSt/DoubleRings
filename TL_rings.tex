\section{Transmission Line Theory of concentric rings}
Two concentric rings in front of a conduncting wall can be discussed
by means of transmission line theory which assignes coupling coefficients
which connect the voltages and currents in both rings to each other:
\begin{equation}
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
U_1(\omega) \\ U_2(\omega)
\end{array}
\right] = \imag \omega\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
L_{11} & L_{12} \\
L_{21} & L_{22}
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
I_1(\omega) \\ I_2(\omega)
\end{array}
\right] 
\end{equation}
